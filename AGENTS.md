# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `articles/` stores individual Markdown posts generated by Zenn; use `YYYY-MM-DDslug.md` to keep chronology clear and avoid collisions.
- `books/` is reserved for long-form Zenn books; create a subdirectory per book with `config.yml` and `chapters/` when starting a manuscript.
- `node_modules/` is vendor output—never edit by hand; update through `npm install` when dependencies change.
- Root metadata (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`) should stay lightweight; document any new tooling in `README.md` and mirror it here when it affects contributors.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` sets up `zenn-cli` locally; rerun after dependency bumps.
- `npx zenn new:article` scaffolds an article with front matter; pass a short slug like `vibecoding-intro`.
- `npx zenn new:book` initializes a book directory structure under `books/`.
- `npx zenn preview` serves drafts at `http://localhost:8000`; use it to verify formatting before opening a PR.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Keep Markdown UTF-8, wrap headings in sentence case, and limit lines to 120 characters for easier diffs.
- YAML front matter should stay compact: two-space indentation, quoted emojis, and lowercase topic tags.
- File slugs and directory names should be lowercase-with-hyphens; avoid spaces and uppercase characters.
- Favor descriptive section headings in content; embed code blocks with language hints (e.g., ```bash) for syntax highlighting.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated tests are not configured; failing `npm test` is expected today. Instead, run `npx zenn preview` and review rendered pages on desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Before submitting, lint front matter by running `npx zenn lint` and resolve any warnings about structure or metadata.
- Capture screenshots of key pages when fixing layout issues so reviewers can confirm the change.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- The repository has no formal commit history yet; adopt Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.) to keep future history searchable.
- Squash commits before merge unless reviewers request otherwise; force-push only to personal branches.
- Pull requests should include: purpose summary, commands run (`npx zenn preview`, `npx zenn lint`), and any screenshots relevant to visual changes.
- Link related GitHub issues when applicable and call out follow-up tasks in a checklist.
